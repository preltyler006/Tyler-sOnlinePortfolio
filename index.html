        <h3>About Me - Tyler Prellwitz</h3>

        <img src="Images\TylerPrellwitz.jpeg" class="Professional_Tyler">

        <p>We all have goals, but how do you reach them? You have to work for them because they won’t just be willed into existence. My goal is to become a software engineer in the future. I am currently working toward that goal by learning some languages in my computer science class, including Python, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (outside of class). I have chosen this career option because I have always found that coding allows me to express my creativity in a way that I am unable to do with other art forms. My plans to achieve this goal are to dedicate my time to not just learning about other languages in the computer science world, but rather how to learn them faster and more efficiently. Coding languages will not stay the same, and in this industry, you have to be able to adapt quickly.
        <br>
        <br>
        To help me along this path, I have acquired certain skills that will help me greatly. I have been figuring out the best way for me to learn efficiently, which is through extra and in-depth note-taking, as well as lots and lots of practice with the languages that I am learning. For example, in my math class, instead of just mindlessly writing down the notes and tossing them once class is over, once I get home I go back over the notes in order to make sure I completely understand them and use them to my advantage when doing homework. I have also learned to type relatively quickly, which is very useful when there is a lot to write out in code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Not everything in the industry is about coding or note-taking or learning, however. You need to be able to collaborate well with others and know how and when to be a leader when the time comes. I have been captain of my hockey team and been able to take command and tell everyone what they need to do and when they need to do it. Being a good collaborator is also very important because you have to realize that you don’t know everything, and other people will have good and useful ideas. Having two minds is better than one, especially when you can communicate with them well. I have demonstrated this throughout the numerous projects in my computer science class, as well as now in my engineering class. I am very capable of leading, learning, and listening in order to get work done.</p>

          <p>Throughout the Summer of 2021 and into the Winter season, I aquired an abundance of experience from working for a private client. I looked after their 5 year old multiple times, including making food for them, playing games, going on walks, and making sure they stayed active and were not on screens all the time.
              <br>
              <br>
Currently, I have a job working at the Dublin Iceland Skating Rink. I have been able to learn how to deal with customers and explaining information to them in a clear and concise manner. Most of the time I will be on the ice with public skate during their hours on Saturdays, making sure that none of the patrons of Iceland get hurt. When public skate is not in session, I am running the booth handing out skates, disinfecting them, and putting them back.</p>

          <h4>App Development: Creative Expression</h4>
          <p><strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Computer Science Essentials</br>
            <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 2 Months (Mid September 2020 - Mid November 2020)<br/>
            <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Create an android app that highlights a hot topic that more people should be aware of.<br/>
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>The hot topic that my partner (Samith Ganesh) and I decided to create an app about was the California wildfires, which was a big topic at the time of making the app. We came up with an idea of having a few tress on fire on the screen, and the user would have to click them to put out the fires. The trees would move slowly on level 1, and slowly would move faster and faster until the final level, where they would move extremely fast. My partner and I worked very well together, communicating effectively inside and outside of class hours. We got our work done on time, and if one of us had a question, we wouldn’t hesitate to ask for help. My role in the project was to add the smaller but important features such as the score counter and the timer at the bottom, as well as styling the app to make it user friendly. We got feedback from our peers multiple times throughout the project, such as adding a border to see where the boundaries for the trees were, and how they would overlap sometimes. We fixed these bugs by adding more “if then” statements to our code, however my emulator was unable to handle all ofthe code because it was an older model. If we had more time to work on the project, we would have made the app more friendly for all devices so that everyone could run it. Our documentation for this project is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qz9L0eQlF3NOJ3Nc7-qdUgz9iRGnI7hifWQwqrM8gJc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, as well as the link to the AIA file for the code <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kkw9OzywIhZd39N6GzUxH89oo49UkE5h/view?usp=sharing"target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h4>Python COVID Escape Room</h4>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Computer Science Essentials</br>
          <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 1 Month (Late March 2021 - Mid April 2021)<br/>
          <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Create an escape room with some aspect of COVID 19 throughout, with questions about the Pandemic.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>I had the same partner for this project as the last one (Samith Ganesh), and we came up with an idea for our project to have a bunch of questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you complete the escape room without losing both lives, then you escape the room. We put each question inside of its own function, so we only have to run one function. My partner and I worked very well together, and the website we used allowed us to both work on the project at the same time. We were constantly bouncing ideas off of each other and making our project work better and better. We had only a couple struggles throughout the project, and fixed them fairly easily. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmBqUmppzAj9DcPjmNpqmvrfYUMfFib1yrp8vAEfVzU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@samgan1012/CSE31Template#Escape_Room_6/Ganesh_Prellwitz_Final.py" target="_blank">game</a> are linked here so you can test them out for yourselves.

        <h4>Project 1.6 Compound Machine Design "XTRA"</h4>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Honors Principles Of Engineering</br>
          <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 2 Weeks (September 14 2021 - September 28 2021)<br/>
          <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Design, build, and test a prototype to pour water for members of the compound. Our machine will transfer liquid from one cup to another<br/>
        </p>
        <p>My partners for this project were Ayush Guha and Sundeep Kalinidi. My role in the project was designing our final prototype as well as building the pulley and cradle system, as well as testing the water spillage and limiting that factor. The most challenging part of the project was getting as little spillage from the cup as possible, as the "jerking" movement from the string always created a big splash. Throughout the project many numerous times, we had to revise our design as there were small things that we overlooked in the design that just did not make sense in real life. For example, I ended up changing the cradle from a bent "U" shape piece of metal to a flatter designed contraption to hold the weight. Throughout the project time and time again, I learned to not underestimate the people that I work with, as we all have equal experience in the engineering field, and they greatly helped with some design choices in the build.

        <h4>Entrepreneurship Project 2021-2022</h4>
          <p>
              <strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Honors Principles Of Engineering</br>
              <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 2 Months (March 17 2022 - May 18 2022)</br>
              <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Design and/or build & test a product to be evaluated by classmates and judges for potential payout in engineering-wide competition. Needs to utilize a topic/skill learned in current year of engineering class, and the product needs to address/solve a current issue/problem in the world.
          </p>
          <p>My partners for this project were Rishit Balaji and Maxwell Vu, both in POE 3rd period with McGarrah. Our problem we attempted to solve was a lack of sanitation in gyms in current times, still in the pandemic from early 2020. Proper cleaning of equipment inbetween uses was near nonexistent, only being cleaned after many gyms have been closed. Our solution was a Dumbbell-Cleaning UV Machine, which would utilize UV-C light from wavelengths 200nm-239nm. At this wavelength, the UV light would disinfect dumbbell grips by eliminating bacteria & viruses (including COVID-19), but still be safe for humans as it would not penetrate human skin. I modeled a CAD prototype for our prodcut, as well as a circuit demonstrating how our product would be wired, both in Tinkercad. I utilized my knowledge from our circuits unit in order to understand the schematic used to create the circuit.

          <h3>Field Trips</h3>
            <p>On September 9th 2021, I attended the JA Tech & Innovation Summit online. There were multiple workshop rooms you could join and I went around a few workshops seeing what they would talk about. For the Amazon one, there was a software engineer demonstrating the ease of use for AWS servers and how you can put together a website and have it hosted by Amazon very quickly. There are a lot of upsides to using their servers that I learned, including the cheapness, reliability, and the ease of use as you could adjust lots of settings very intuitively. They even had a simulated quantam computer able to do quantum tasks through whatever language you had! Overall, the speaker summed it up that you don't need to be a tech wiz who writes thousands of lines of code in order to get a well paying job.</p>

        <h3>Influential Speakers</h3>
            <p>On December 8th 2021, I attended the speaker event with Donald James as he talked about his career in NASA. He was employed in 1982 and retired in 2017, meaning he worked at NASA for 35 years!. His job was to inform kids and teens about things concerning space travel through NASA. In 1986 however, after the Challenger II accident, he went around to schools to talk about what went so wrong and help preserve their image. Throughout his speech, the topic of perserverence and manners came up many time, as he had written a book called <i>"Manners Will Take You Where Brains and Money Won't: Wisdom from Momma and 35 Years at NASA"</i>. His presentation had a very good outlook on the engineering career industry, and how you always should be focused on being good at your job. However, being respectful and having good manners will get you farther in life than just your brain will.</p>

            <p>On February 16, 2022, I attended a speaker presentation by Kimberli Zhong and she talked about her career through computer science. She was the first graduating class of DHS to be in the engineering academy in 2014. She studied computer science at MIT and moved back to the bay area to join a few internships starting with Google, then to Airbnb, and now at a startup named "Applied Intuition". At her job now, she designs simulations for testing vehicles before uploading the software to self driving cars. Currently, she leads an engineering team in her company of about 7 people, making her way up the ranks after starting with the company from their early days. This speaker was very inspirational to me because she was an Asian American woman, being able to thrive in this career while facing hints of sexism and racism.</p>

            <p>On April 13, 2022, I went to a speaker presentation by Kathleen Morse. She is a materials science expert, and is the founder & major owner of Yosemite Space. She got her bachelor from MIT and finished her Masters and PHD at Stanford. Her company designs small computers to be put into space on rockets that are able to withstand and prevent single event effects. These effects are tiny radiation particles messing with electrons, which can be catastrophic if hit in the wrong place at the wrong time. These small computers have "gumstix" cpus in them, and as the title suggests, they are the size of a gumstick. These cpus when put in space experienced no single event effects, proving their usefulness and potency.</p>
