        <h3>About Me - Tyler Prellwitz</h3>

        <img src="Images\TylerPrellwitz.jpeg" class="Professional_Tyler">

        <p>We all have goals, but how do you reach them? You have to work for them because they won’t just be willed into existence. My goal is to become a software engineer in the future. I am currently working toward that goal by learning some languages in my computer science class, including Python, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (outside of school). I have chosen this career option because I have always found that coding allows me to express my creativity in a way that I am unable to do with other art forms. My plans to achieve this goal are to dedicate my time to not just learning about other languages in the computer science world, but rather how to learn them faster and more efficiently. Coding languages will not stay the same, and in this industry, you have to be able to adapt quickly.</p>

        <p>To help me along this path, I have acquired certain skills that will help me greatly. I have been figuring out the best way for me to learn efficiently, which is through extra and in-depth note-taking, as well as lots and lots of practice with the languages that I am learning. For example, in my math class, instead of just mindlessly writing down the notes and tossing them once class is over, once I get home I go back over the notes in order to make sure I completely understand them and use them to my advantage when doing homework. I have also learned to type relatively quickly, which is very useful when there is a lot to write out in code.</p>

        <p>Not everything in the industry is about coding or note-taking or learning, however. You need to be able to collaborate well with others and know how and when to be a leader when the time comes. I have been captain of my hockey team and been able to take command and tell everyone what they need to do and when they need to do it. Being a good collaborator is also very important because you have to realize that you don’t know everything, and other people will have good and useful ideas. Having two minds is better than one, especially when you can communicate with them well. I have demonstrated this throughout the numerous projects in my computer science class, being able to communicate my ideas as well as listening to others and taking their feedback. Not everyone can spend hours a day looking at a computer screen full of colorful text figuring out what is wrong with their code, but I enjoy figuring out my mistakes. Ultimately, that is the most important thing in having a good job; enjoying what you do.</p>

          <h4>App Development: Creative Expression</h4>
          <p><strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Computer Science Essentials</br>
            <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 2 Months (Mid September 2020 - Mid November 2020)<br/>
            <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Create an android app that highlights a hot topic that more people should be aware of.<br/>
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>The hot topic that my partner (Samith Ganesh) and I decided to create an app about was the California wildfires, which was a big topic at the time of making the app. We came up with an idea of having a few tress on fire on the screen, and the user would have to click them to put out the fires. The trees would move slowly on level 1, and slowly would move faster and faster until the final level, where they would move extremely fast. My partner and I worked very well together, communicating effectively inside and outside of class hours. We got our work done on time, and if one of us had a question, we wouldn’t hesitate to ask for help. My role in the project was to add the smaller but important features such as the score counter and the timer at the bottom, as well as styling the app to make it user friendly. We got feedback from our peers multiple times throughout the project, such as adding a border to see where the boundaries for the trees were, and how they would overlap sometimes. We fixed these bugs by adding more “if then” statements to our code, however my emulator was unable to handle all ofthe code because it was an older model. If we had more time to work on the project, we would have made the app more friendly for all devices so that everyone could run it. Our documentation for this project is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qz9L0eQlF3NOJ3Nc7-qdUgz9iRGnI7hifWQwqrM8gJc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, as well as the link to the AIA file for the code <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kkw9OzywIhZd39N6GzUxH89oo49UkE5h/view?usp=sharing"target="_blank">here.</a>

        <h4>Python COVID Escape Room</h4>
        <p>
          <strong><u>Course:</u></strong> Computer Science Essentials</br>
          <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong> 1 Month (Late March 2021 - Mid April 2021)<br/>
          <strong><u>Objective:</u></strong> Create an escape room with some aspect of COVID 19 throughout, with questions about the Pandemic.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>I had the same partner for this project as the last one (Samith Ganesh), and we came up with an idea for our project to have a bunch of questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you complete the escape room without losing both lives, then you escape the room. We put each question inside of its own function, so we only have to run one function. My partner and I worked very well together, and the website we used allowed us to both work on the project at the same time. We were constantly bouncing ideas off of each other and making our project work better and better. We had only a couple struggles throughout the project, and fixed them fairly easily. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TmBqUmppzAj9DcPjmNpqmvrfYUMfFib1yrp8vAEfVzU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@samgan1012/CSE31Template#Escape_Room_6/Ganesh_Prellwitz_Final.py" target="_blank">game</a> are linked here so you can test them out for yourselves.
